Datatypes in Javascript

string : everything inside " "(double quotes),' '(single quotes) are considered as string values. We use '+' operator to append string values.
eg. var a="apple";
      var b=" is a fruit";
      var c=a+b;        //apple is a fruit

number : All the numbers from -(2^53-1) to (2^53-1) are number datatype. 
eg. var a=10;

boolean : This datatype gives output as True or False 

null : used when we intentionally want to define a variable as empty  
eg. let emp=null;

undefined : A variable that have not assigned 
eg. let a;

list : collection of data items. Defined using [](brackets)
eg. let lis=["flowers","Fruits","Trees"];
